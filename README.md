## interests

I grew up in Port-au-Prince, Haiti and have a deep love of sunshine, travel, and creating solutions that improve everday quality of life. Beyond coding, I enjoy rock-climbing and cycling and any other form of adventuring outdoors. I'm also an artist and dabble in creating my own paint from scratch (*read: grinds up rocks into fine powder to use their pigment*).
